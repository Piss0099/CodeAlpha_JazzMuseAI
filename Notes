# JazzMuseAI - Notes & Challenges

1. Needed a MIDI dataset.
   → Used free jazz MIDI files from open source sites.

2. Training takes time and memory.
   → Reduced epochs and batch size for demo purposes.

3. Added saving of generated melody as "generated_music.mid".
   → Now we can actually listen to the output.
